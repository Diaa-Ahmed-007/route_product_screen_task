# Product Display Screen

## Overview
This project is a Flutter application that displays a list of products fetched from an API. The application is built using clean architecture, MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, repository pattern, and dependency injection to ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase. The UI is adaptive, providing a seamless experience across different screen sizes and orientations.

## Features
- **Clean Architecture**: Ensures separation of concerns and facilitates testing and maintenance.
- **MVVM Pattern**: Implements MVVM to manage the UI logic separately from the business logic.
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts the data source, providing a consistent API for data access.
- **Dependency Injection**: Manages dependencies efficiently using a DI framework.
- **Adaptive UI**: Provides a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes and orientations.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter**: Framework for building the UI.
- **Dio**: HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Bloc**: State management solution using the BLoC pattern.
- **GetIt**: Dependency injection framework.
